# de-nlp-train-set
This is a toolset to create a German NLP training set with labels from the German wikipedia. The goal is to supply a big german dataset as a reference for NLP experiments. This way different deep learning networks and techniques like preprocessing can be compared. The program files are jupyter notebooks (including the output) so you can see what happened during execution.
